CAJILES, ALVIN M.

REFLECTION

Working on this portfolio has been both a challenge and a chance to learn. One of the main difficulties I faced was organizing my projects in a consistent and professional way. At first, my repositories had different structures, incomplete documentation, and unclear explanations, which made it harder to present my work. To fix this, I created a standard format for my READMEs. This format includes sections like description, installation steps, screenshots, and demo links. It helped bring clarity and uniformity across my projects.

Another challenge was deployment, especially when builds worked locally but failed on platforms like GitHub Pages or Netlify. I tackled this by learning how to replicate production environments, manage environment variables properly, and follow a checklist before publishing.

Through this process, I also saw the importance of accessibility, performance, and good version control. Small changes like optimizing images, writing clearer commits, and using lightweight frameworks made a big difference. Looking ahead, I want to improve my portfolio by adding more detailed case studies of my projects, enhancing search and filter features, and conducting a full accessibility review. Overall, this project taught me not only technical skills but also how to present my work clearly and effectively.
